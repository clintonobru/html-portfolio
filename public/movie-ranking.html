<h3>Kingsman</h3>

<p>A britrish spy movice waering suits to take down criminals.</p>

<p>
Bespoke suits and polished flair,<br />
A secret service beyond compare.<br />
Umbrellas hide blades, gadgets gleam,<br />
A noble cause, a spy's grand dream.<br />

From pub brawls to villainous schemes,<br />
Manners maketh man, or so it seems.<br />
Eggsy rises, a rough diamond refined,<br />
A Kingsman forged, both sharp and kind.<br />

Explosions, intrigue, a plot to foil,<br />
Heroes emerge from danger and toil.<br />
With wit and style, they save the day,<br />
The Kingsman's charm won't fade away.<br />
</p>

<h3>Roadhouse</h3>

<p>An ex boxer kills his opposition in the ring then quits fighting because of the incident,
then starts looking for a job as a bodyguard in a bar.</p>

<p>
In the smoky glow of the Double Deuce,<br />
Where fists flew freely and tempers were loose,<br />
Dalton arrived, calm yet strong,<br />
A man of peace where chaos belonged.<br />

With wisdom sharp and moves precise,<br />
He tamed the wild with his rule: "Be nice."<br />
But when danger struck, his fury burned,<br />
And justice was swift as tables turned.<br />

Through broken glass and battles won,<br />
The road was hard, but he'd never run.<br />
Daltonâ€™s legend still holds its place,<br />
A fighter, a savior, with unmatched grace.<br />
</p>

<h3>The Martrix</h3>

<p>A futuristic world of a group of people who want's to stop the robot invation</p>

<p>
A world of code, a hidden lie,<br />
Where truth and freedom dare to vie.<br />
Red pill chosen, minds unchained,<br />
A fight for life, where hope remains.<br />
