<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi there! I'm Clinton an aspiring web developer on an exciting journey of learning and creating. I'm currently diving 
  deep into the world of web development, starting with the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>One of my recent projects was a nostalgic dive into the 90s web era, where I created a simple, CSS-free website using 
  pure HTML documents. It might seem basic, but it taught me a lot about the roots of web design and how far we've come.</p>

<p>I'm ambitious, creative, hard-working, and relentless in pursuing my goals. Every project I take on, no matter how small, 
  is a step toward honing my skills and becoming a better developer. I believe in continuous growth, and I'm committed to 
  learning and improving every single day.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to see how far I can go. Welcome to my world of learning, building, and achieving!</p>
